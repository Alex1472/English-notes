I heard the rain patter against/on the window. Ben banged his fist on the desk. The clock in the hall chimed six. The gates clanged shut behind her. The tray slipped and clattered to the floor. Thunder crashed and boomed outside. Machines hummed on the factory floor. The wind blew hard, rattling the doors and windows. The engines roared.
We could hear thunder rumbling in the distance. He rustled the papers on his desk. She was screeching at him at the top of her voice.
