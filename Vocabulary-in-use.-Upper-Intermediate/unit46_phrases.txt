The kids have been really noisy today.
He reached out and stroked her cheek tenderly.
He patted the dog affectionately.
She tapped her fingers nervously on the table.

He woke up with a foul taste in his mouth.
a pile of foul-smelling garbage
the putrid smells from the slaughterhouses
The library was full of musty old books which no one wanted to read.
The onion smell still sharp and pungent.
The forest was cool and fragrant, and the walk through it calmed my spirits.
the sweet scent of ripe fruit.
It had the delicate perfume of roses.
Honeysuckle and roses scented the air.
Lilacs perfumed the air.
The dry cold air was scented with wood smoke.
